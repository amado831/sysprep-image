Sometimes you will get an error that says" Sysprep was not able to validate your Windows installation. 
Review the log file at %WINDIR%System32\Sysprep\Panther\setupact.log for details. After resolving the issue, use Sysprep to validate
your installation again. 

What does that mean? It means that sysprep wants apps to be removed. The setupact.log file will tell you what to remove to be able to run Sysprep.
